                                                        ft_containers

Possible implementation of some containers from the standard library C++ (C98):

-Vector
-Stack
-Map
-Set

In the repo you have my own tests but if you want more you can run mli tester (https://github.com/mli42/containers_test) or mazoise tester (https://github.com/Mazoise/42TESTERS-CONTAINERS)
